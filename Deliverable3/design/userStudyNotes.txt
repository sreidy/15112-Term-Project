Notes from user study

During the user study I had four different people test my game I noticed that 
the issues with my game were that I had a lack of instruction, leading to confused 
players.  This issue was present in the three of the four individuals tested in the
 user study. For one test I needed to intervene and explain the game, after she 
 stayed within the starting cell without moving to the next cell in the maze. 

What Can Be Done:
- To fix this issue I can add a help screen to the game that would show the 
games objective, and explain how the wall system works.   
-  At the start Screen of the game have a side menu that will have a list of 
controls and game explanation 
- pressing ?h? in game will bring up a help screen 


Another Issue with my project that I noticed when people were using it were that 
the game itself was too difficult. Because each cell of the maze can have an 
random number of enemies within itself, it is difficult to control.  Often
 players would move into the next cell and become overwhelmed by the enemy?s  
 closing in, instead of attempting to shoot the enemies the players would often
 just panic and stand still. 

Another issue I found that player often did not know when they were taking damage,
 and often walk though the fire, loose and then become confused on why they lost .

What Can Be Done:
- I can make the enemies deal less damage to the player
- I can make the enemies slower in speed
- I can add a sound or flash to notify the player that they are taking damage
