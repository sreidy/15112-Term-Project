Project Changes 


Form a quick brose of the OldProject Folder it is easy to see how much my 
project has changes science its inception. My project originality started as a quad-copter 
game. that was going to incorporate a 3D robots development platform quad- copter that I 
spent many hours during the start of the semester building , and 
Open CV vision tracing. The original vision for the project was to have the helicopter
provide a birds eye view of the player. The  player will look at pc  and need 
to physically move to avoid running into the virtual walls. As the player moves 
forward in the physical space, the copter will track the location and move according to 
the players motions. 

Progress on this original idea was going well during the first week,I was able to 
    - Get the Quad copter to respond to RC commands
    - Was able to interface with wireless video feed with open CV, using 
      an old android smart phone as an ip- camera 

But after sinking the first 2 weeks into this design I became aware that my data, 
radio that is comply needed to interface python with the quad copter, was only able, to send 
packets of information was was unable to revive information packets. I spent the entire 
weekend of the projects second week troubleshooting the communication. At this point I made a 
decision to move to plan B, which is the current project I am turning in.
