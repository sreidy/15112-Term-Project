    http://hackaday.com/2013/05/13/gopro-hack-delivers-live-video-feed-for-piloting-your-quadcopter/
    - Wireless video transfer using broadcast equipment allows for greate 
      range
    
    
    - Anti-Features
        - Wireless video rig requires second external batteries
        - Broadcast equipment very expensive 
        - Does not use video as a web cam but rather as just a video stream 
        - Go Pro camera expensive 
        
        
AR Drone:
    This is a off the shelf wi-fi controlled quadcpter that has two built in 
    webcams. The copter can be controlled with IOS and Android smart devices.
    The quad copter uses its built in web cams to playe games, It can also track 
    the location of players who are wearing bright orange and yellow hats.
    
    - Anti features
        - Battery life short and flight time is limited 
        - VERY EXPENSIVE 
        - can not hold much weight other than itself
        - Software is not compatible with Python 
        
DIY Follow Me Drone 
    http://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/the-diy-kidtracking-drone
    This is a project used the same Control board that I plan to use for the project 
    This project also uses the same on ground software Mission Planer that I want 
    to use .
    Want to mimic the same type of control with the quad copter using a ground
    PC to communicate with the quad copter.

    Note:
        the creator eventually called that this project is cool but impractical
        due to the 10M inaccuracy of the GPS data 
    - Anti- Features
        - Does not use vision tracking instead uses GPS data to track location of 
        human player, GPS too complicated for my term project goals 
        - GPS inaccurate
