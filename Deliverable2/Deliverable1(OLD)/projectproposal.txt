15-112 Term Project Proposal

My project will involve 4 major hardware components   
    - 3DRobotics Quad dev platform 
        - adurnio Mega based quad-copter 
        - can run python scripts using mission planing software
        
    - Old Android SmartPhone
        - Used as an IP camera to get live video from the helicopter
        
    - WIFI router
        - Used to facilitate connection between ground pc and the old smart phone
          on the copter
        
    - (Stretch Goal) Oclus Rift 
        - Used to overlay copter footage to human 
        
My project Will involve 5 packages of software
    - 3dRobotcs Mission Planing software 
        - python class to control copter 
        -  python class description found here
            -http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/common-using-python-scripts-in-mission-planner/
    - Open CV (vision Tracking )
    - Tkinter (game aspect )
    -URLLIB for communication to an old android phone located on a quadcopter 
    -SimScript   for virtual joystick control
            -http://code.google.com/p/fscode/wiki/SimScript
    
        
        
Main Idea:
    Augment Reality game.
        - Using the helicopter to provide a birds eye view of the player, the 
        player will look at pc (or using oclus) and need to physically move to 
        avoid running into the virtual walls. As the player moves forward in the 
        physical space, the copter will track the location and move according to 
        the players motions.

       -The Maze Game
            - This will be a portion of my project that is a tkinter oop game, that
            will have the player moving through a randomly generated maze ( for testing
            pre written mazes will be used ) the player will be represented by and orange box.
            Surounding the player is a 100 X 100 pixle large binding box, the player position can move 
            only within the binding box. When the player is in contact with one of the sides of the 
            binding box is when the maze walls will move in the opposite direction as the side, to create the 
            illusion of movement through a maze.
                  ---top---             top --> maze moves down
                  -       -             right --> maze move left 
              left-       -right        left --> maze move Right 
                  -       -             bottom --> maze move up 
                  ---------
                    bottom 
                    
            - The background of the maze will be the video from the camera located on the copter 
            
        - Camera 
            - Using openCv and urllib I will use a app to create an ip camera using an old smart phone
              the player will be underneath the quad copter  will have a bright orange hat on for vision 
              tracking. the centrer position of the player will be passed into the maze game to draw the position of the player.
              
                  ---top---             top --> copter moves forward
                  -       -             right --> maze move right 
              left-       -right        left --> maze move left 
                  -       -             bottom --> maze move backwards  
                  ---------
                    bottom 
              
        - Copter control 
            - Using tkinter bindings to simulate a joystick, the copter will use the same 
            binding box collision as the maze game. 
            - pressing "i" initializes copter 
            - pressing space will make the copter take off or land 
The How:
    - I will have an Ip camera attached to the quad copter looking directly at the 
        ground. The copter will fly to a set height, and then look for the player 
        with a bright orange hat on, where the quad copter will centre itself over the
        player. As the player moves closer to the edge of the screen the quad copter will move
        to re-centrer the player under its view. 
        
    - The Game:
        The player is tasked to move through a maze without touching the walls.
        

BackUp Plan:
    - If for some reason I cannot get the quad copter or the vision tracking to
    work my backup plan would be to take the maze game and polish it up add music and submit 
    just the maze game as my project
