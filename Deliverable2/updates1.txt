Updates to the Project

After leading that the issue with my quadroter is one that would take too much time to fix. 
I decided to remove it remove from my project. MY new plan is to take the maze generation 
code that I have, and make a dungeon crawling game. Unfortunately this means That I am slightly behind
where I wanted to be in my project. But currently I have cell by cell maze scrolling working, and a model system
That will make it easy to implement a event into the maze. The event could be a puzzle, a key, or an enemy.


My working version of my demo is titled demo V2
